This project demonstrates a smooth-animated 2D GUI of a coffee machine, which is based on the hardware setup of a STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H563ZI and RVA35HI LCD expansion board from RIVERDI.

Notes: Use TouchGFX 4.24.0 to open the TouchGFX project. The project is only a reference. As it has already been recognized by STMicroelectronics, do not use it directly. Instead, use it as a reference.
